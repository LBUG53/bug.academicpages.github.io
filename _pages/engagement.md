# Consulting

The only thing worse than making decisions without data is making them with the wrong data. Too often, consultants hand institutions a generic report, recycling the same charts from their last client. The result is advice that doesn’t reflect your reality.

I started consulting to do things differently. I pair the clear analysis of a data specialist with the contextual insight of a historian. Colleges and universities are complex institutions, and lasting solutions require more than bar charts in your school’s colors—they require bringing people together and building coalitions for change.

My work has supported leaders from Harvard to the Baltimore public school system, helping decision-makers in very different contexts move forward with clarity and confidence.

## How I Work

I don’t drop a thick report on your desk and leave. Instead, I:  
1. Learn your institution’s context first.  
2. Work with your leadership to define the right questions.  
3. Build analysis that is clear, accessible, and tailored.  
4. Partner with you to share findings and create buy-in across campus.
