When we tell the story of American higher education, whose influence do we recognize?
My research asks that question and shows how traditional histories often leave out people who have a significant impact on these institutions: students, community members, and local stakeholders whose impact on decision-making has been overlooked for decades.
In my Harvard PhD dissertation, I focused on graduate schools of education, institutions closely tied to their local communities. By centering the contributions that are usually missing, I found that our understanding of these schools, and of higher education more broadly, changes in important ways. This work challenges long-held assumptions about who matters in higher education and what counts as evidence when we tell institutional stories.
Alongside this historical research, I have extensive quantitative analysis experience. As Assistant Director of Research at the Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE), I advised leaders at 35 colleges and universities on issues such as enrollment, student experience, and finance. In that role, I worked directly with senior administrators to interpret data and guide responses to pressing challenges.
I founded Red Brick Advising to bring these perspectives together. Through the company, I help higher education leaders make historically informed decisions by combining historical research with quantitative analysis. I outlined this approach in Inside Higher Ed in an article called "A Call for Historically Informed Decisions".
I am also a dedicated teacher. I have taught undergraduates, masterâ€™s students, and PhD students at Brown, Harvard, and the University of Michigan, and I always return to the same principle: learning is richer when we include a wider range of perspectives.
Above all, I believe the world is better when more people are curious and kind. That philosophy shapes my scholarship, my consulting, and the way I try to expand whose contributions are recognized in the history of higher education.
