## Book Project
**Anchors of Identity: The Many Paths to Prestige in the American University**  
The history of the American graduate school of education is, by most accounts, a history of failure. The dominant narrative, solidified by a handful of foundational works, claims that these institutions, caught between the impossible demands of training teachers, producing research, and shaping policy, inevitably retreat into the ivory tower, chasing academic prestige at the expense of their profession.  

*Anchors of Identity* challenges this story. Through a comparative history of three of the nation’s most influential graduate schools of education—Harvard (HGSE), Penn (PennGSE), and Teachers College, Columbia (TC)—the book argues that the canonical narrative is incomplete. Drawing on newly available archival materials, it introduces the concept of **“anchors of identity”**: durable, historically-shaped commitments to specific constituencies and reputational strategies that provide institutional continuity, especially in times of crisis.  

By tracing how these distinct identities were forged, tested, and revealed in moments of crisis, *Anchors of Identity* demonstrates that academic prestige is not the only measure that matters. Each form of service—research, regional influence, or comprehensive practitioner training—brought its own form of prestige. This book not only corrects the history of education schools but also offers a new way of writing the history of the American university:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
