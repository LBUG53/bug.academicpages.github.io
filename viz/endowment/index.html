          <p>It seems like every job requires an undergraduate degree now, and the cost to attend college is growing faster than inflation. Why should colleges charge so much for something people need? Why does an institution like Harvard, with a $53 billion endowment, receive so much money from the federal government?</p>
          <p>These are good questions, and with the Trump administration's multi-pronged assault on Harvard, they are increasingly relevant and have become a prominent part of the national conversation. Higher education leaders and their allies have tried to explain the finances of their institutions, but they struggle to make themselves heard. A part of the problem is the way that they try to communicate these complex issues, largely relying on dense text crafted by the CFO and the General Counsel or graphics pulled from their annual financial statements. This is how I explain it to my friends:</p>
          <p>Harvard is the richest university in the world, with over $53 billion in endowment and who knows how much else in property and other assets. This endowment grew out of centuries of philanthropic gifts from donors, who gave money to Harvard with the understanding that it would be used for its intended purpose. Let's say a 19th century railroad magnate wanted Harvard to have someone teach the next generation of railroad leaders. The magnate could give Harvard enough money to cover the cost of a professor of railroads in perpetuity, creating what's called an "endowed position." That money, and the interest on that money, cannot be used for anything other than a professor in railroads. If by the 21st century there aren't any scholars who study railroads, that money sits unused.</p>
          <p>Funds that must be spent on a specific thing or in a specific way are called restricted funds. Most of a college's endowment is restricted. Here is a breakdown of Harvard's endowment, with the unrestricted money in blue.</p>
